This is an engine under development to easily create RPG's in love2d, but really with a bit of modification, it could be used to make all kinds of tile based top down games. 
It works on a system of a tileset, and a list of entities. Entites all derive from one centeral entity class, and are everything that doesn't fit on the grid. This incldes the player, npcs, and any interactables. 
I eventually hope to use it to develop an RPG with some friends.
